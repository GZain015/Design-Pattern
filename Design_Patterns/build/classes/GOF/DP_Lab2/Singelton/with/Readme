Singelton:
A Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance


Problem Statement:
    Implement a Singleton billing system for an e-commerce application. Ensure that only one instance is responsible for calculating and processing invoices.

This system implements singelton lazy initializaion and double check locking in billingSystem class to create a single instance only.

It has methods for generating invoices and printing the list of generated invoices.

The Invoice class is a private inner class used to represent individual invoices with customer names and amounts.

In the DP_lab2 class, we demonstrate how to access the Singleton BillingSystem instance and use it to generate invoices and print them.
